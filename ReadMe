***Instructions:***

Run the Main.java file from GUI to launch the GUI or from clui to launch using
console

Select players for the game by following the instructions in the pop-up boxes
when first starting the game.

If two AIs are playing against each other, you will not be able to interact
with the board.

If it is your turn and you are a human player, you may interact with the board
by hovering your mouse over a space you want to move to. If the space is valid,
a blue 'X' or 'O' will display over the space depending on which player you are.
Click on the space to move there.

Once the game is over, a dialog box will appear and display if there is a tie or
a winner. If there is a winner, the winning line will be highlighted in red.

Click the red close button at the top right of the window at any time to terminate
the program.
